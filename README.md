Location based chatrooms for mobile devices


## Backend Overview
The backend consists of a few different systems working together. 
These pieces are:
* Apache Kafka
* Apache Flink
* PostgreSQL (with PostGIS)
* maybe more???


### Apache Kafka


### Apache Flink


### PostgreSQL/PostGIS





## Frontend Overview
As of now the plan for the front end is to be developed in Kotlin, as it has support on both IOS and Android. 
I plan on supporting this app on both platforms but IOS will be the primary platform. I do also plan on supporting tablets like iPads.
